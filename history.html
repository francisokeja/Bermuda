        <p1>BERMUDA TRIANGLE</p1>
        <p2>The history of bermuda triangle remains a mystery to the world 
            Many Events have happend in the bermuda triangle many people say that it is the devil pit while 
            others say it is where the devil is kept
            The bermuda triangle is a mythical section of the atlantic ocean where dozens of ship and airplanes
                have disappered.an unexplained circumstances surrounding some of these incident, including one in which 
            the pilots of a squadron of THE U.S navy bomber became disoriented while flying over the area ; the plane 
            was never found other boats and planes have also vanished from the area in a good weather without even radio 
            distress message but although myraid fanciful theory have been proposed regardly thr bermuda triangle none of
            them prove that mysterious disapperance occours more frequently there than any other well train section of the
            ocean .
            infact people navigate the area without incident. when christopher columbus sailed through that area on his first
            voyage to a new world he reported that a great flame of fire [PROBABLY A METOER] crashed into into the sea one 
            night and that a strage light appered in the distance about a few weeks later. he also wrote about ERRATIC COMPASS 
            READING perhaps because at that time a silver of the bermuda triangle was one of a few places on earth where true
            north and magnetic nort lined up.
